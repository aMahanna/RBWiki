# Rube's Wiki

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldberg Machine</a> for accessing condensed Wikipedia page content through photo recognition. 

A live demo can be found [here](http://rubeswiki.glitch.me/).

Built with Express, using Javscript, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, and the Google Cloud Vision & MediaWiki APIs.

It was originally intended for taking pictures of LP Records and getting condensed Wiki info about their album & band, but it can work with other things, like a book cover. 

You will need the following to make your own:
- [Google Cloud API Key](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys) (this is set as GCP_API_KEY ENV variable)
